Welcome to the repository for the **Auth 16 UI Kit**, an essential collection of **16 high-fidelity components** designed to streamline the creation of user authentication and account management flows in [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/).

This kit enables you to quickly prototype critical user journeys with a clean, professional design, avoiding the need to start from scratch.

## 📦 What's Included

This repository provides the core assets needed to immediately use this 16-component library:

1.  **`auth-16.excalidrawlib`**
    * Contains all **16 high-fidelity prefabs** that cover the entire user account lifecycle.
    * Elements share a unified aesthetic (based on a violet/purple theme) for visual consistency across your diagrams.

2.  **`index.html`**
    * A custom landing page for showcasing and previewing the 16 prefabs.
    * Simplifies integration by allowing you to instantly load the entire collection into an Excalidraw board via a dedicated button.

## ✨ Key Features

* **High-Fidelity Flows:** The 16 components are highly detailed, accelerating the transition from *wireframe* to design *mockup*.
* **Critical Coverage:** The kit covers **90% of essential account flows** including `Login`, `Signup`, `Password Recovery`, `Email Verification`, `Account Details`, and various `Error` states.
* **Thematic Consistency:** The entire series maintains a unified style, ensuring uniformity in all projects built using this library.
* **Open Source:** Free to use, modify, and contribute under the MIT License.

## 🚀 Usage Guide
¡Mis disculpas de nuevo! Tienes toda la razón. A pesar de incluir el texto, el resaltado de código en mi respuesta anterior pudo haber sido confuso o fragmentario.

El objetivo es que TODO el contenido del README esté dentro del bloque cat para que se pueda ejecutar como un único script Bash.

Aquí está el código Bash completo y correcto, que incluye todo el contenido del README.md:
